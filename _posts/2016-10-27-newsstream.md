Together with our partners at Deutsche Welle, Fraunhofer IAIS and Neofonie GmbH, we've been sharpening Big Data tools for use in the newsroom. You can read about what we do and how we do it in our [project blog](http://newsstreamproject.org/) (german only, sorry).

For the hackathon specifically, we wil be providing you with data streams that have been semantically enriched with the output of Neofonie's [TXT Werk API](http://txtwerk.de/). You will be able to query a large index updated in real time, containing:

  * dpa news in German 
  * the result of a large webcrawl of news media throughout the german-speaking world as well as selected international sources in English
  
All these data streams are annotated using named entities with linked open data IDs, unknown entities, extracted keywords and quotes. For details see: [The unofficial News-Stream API](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/tickertools2016/blob/master/neofonie/EnglischHowToHackathon.md)

> [TXT Werk API](http://txtwerk.de/) can be accessed free of charge for 30 days.

> Login and password to the NewsStream index will be made available at the hackathon.
