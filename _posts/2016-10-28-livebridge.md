Millions of users read dpa-Live updates when a new US president is elected or an ongoing attack of unknown origin keeps the nation awake. (Here's a [german description](https://www.dpa.com/de/produkte-services/liveticker-newsblogs/#liveticker) of the dpa-Live service). We strive to deliver these updates live to whatever publishing system our customers chose. So we developed the open-source software Livebridge as part of a project funded by the [Google DNI Fund](https://blog.sourcefabric.org/en/news/blog/3434/Introducing-Live-Coverage-Ecosystem-funded-by-Google.htm). It's open source, and it will be formally unveiled at the start of the hackathon. 

We're already using it in production, delivering content produced using Sourcefabric's Liveblog in the dpa newsroom to media customers who use the service of ScribbleLive. It features a plugin structure, so if you want to receive dpa live blog updates in your system, the hackathon is a good place to start development. The repositories with Livebridge and three plugins (for Slack, ScribbleLive and Liveblog) will be made available before the hackathon, as well as a plugin skeleton to jumpstart coding. Hint: Python knowledge is a real advantage here.
