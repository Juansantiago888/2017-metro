Millions of users read dpa-Live updates when a new US president is elected or an ongoing attack of unknown origin keeps the nation awake. (Here's a [german description](https://www.dpa.com/de/produkte-services/liveticker-newsblogs/#liveticker) of the dpa-Live service). We strive to deliver these updates live to whatever publishing system our customers chose. So we developed the open-source software [Livebridge](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge/), to be formally unveiled at the start of the hackathon. Livebridge is partly funded by the [Google DNI Innovation Fund](https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/fund/). Here's a starting point for the project: ["Introducing Live Coverage Ecosystem"](https://blog.sourcefabric.org/en/news/blog/3434/Introducing-Live-Coverage-Ecosystem-funded-by-Google.htm). 

We're already using Livebridge in production, delivering content produced using Sourcefabric's Liveblog in the dpa newsroom to media customers who use the service of ScribbleLive. It features a plugin structure, so if you want to receive dpa live blog updates in your system, the hackathon is a good place to start development. The repositories with [Livebridge](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge/) and three plugins (for [Slack](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge-slack), [ScribbleLive](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge-scribblelive) and [Liveblog](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge-liveblog)) are already public. It's not complicated to write a plugin.
