During the hackathon, you will get access to a realtime API for dpa's market-leading Basisdienst ([german description](https://www.dpa.com/de/produkte-services/text/basisdienst/)), a german language text wire service updated 24/7 by 1300 journalists from around the world, a trusted source of information for hundreds of media, government and business organizations worldwide. Additionally, the API can be used to access selected parts of dpa's multimedia wire Weblines ([german
description](https://www.dpa.com/de/produkte-services/text/weblines/)), a ready-to-publish service that includes curated packages of images and texts.
Both services will be available with live updates as-it-happens.

This API is based on <a hef="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>, Google's real-time hosted database for all flavours of desktop and mobile apps, with Android, iOS, Browser and Server setups ready to go. To wet your appetite, we'll prepare a minimal Javascript web app that gets you a dpa live newsticker.

Depending on your ideas we might be opening other internal APIs for the duration of the hackathon.
