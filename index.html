<p>For the Hackathon, dpa and its partners will open some previously private APIs and toolkits that enable you to work with dpa content during the hackathon. 
  We will update these pages with details and code as the hackathon approaches. If you have any questions, please 
  contact us at <span style="color: #808080">xxxxxx</span>
</p>

<a id="firebase-content-api" class="anchor" href="#firebase-content-api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Firebase Content API</h3>

<p>dpa's market-leading Basisdienst, the german language wire text service with over 500 news and other
  items per day, subscribed to by several hundred organizations 
  worldwide, and its ready-to publish multimedia wire Weblines will be available with live updates as-it happens and a two-week 
  archive on <a hef="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>, Google's real-time hosted platform for all flavours of apps. 
  To wet your appetite, we've prepared a bare-bones 13-line Javascript web app that gets a dpa live newsticker. At request, 
  we will make these wire services available via Amazon's S3, where live updates.

<a id="livebridge" class="anchor" href="#livebridge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Firebase Content API</h3>

<p>Millions of users read dpa's live blog updates when a new US president is chosen or an ongoing attack of onknown origin
  keeps the nation on the edge of their seats. We strive to deliver these live blogs to whatever system our customer chose, and 
  have developed the open-source software Livebridge, who will be formally unveiled at the start of the Hackathon. We're using
  it in production, delivering content produced in Sourcefabric's Liveblog in the dpa newsroom to media 
  customers who use ScribbleLive. It features a plugin structure, so if you want to receive dpa live blog updates in your system, 
  the hackathon is a good place to start development. The repositories with Livebridge and three plugins (for Slack, ScribbleLive
  and Liveblog) will be made available before the hackathon, as well as a plugin skeleton to jumpstart coding.
